DANIEL DAUM Industrial Design Portfolio 2015IDEAS.

SO... THAT'S ME! 

I am Daniel, a fresh industrial design graduate (BA) from Germany. From a very young age, I have had a passion for the arts and design with the result that now I am passionately curious about things. 

It is very exciting to study and act in a field that is a hobby - or rather - have a passion that is a career. 

Describing me in a couple of words I say positive, hard-working, happy and purposeful. I highly respect and appretiate all this beautiful and unique moments and things, which enriches our every day life. I have many interests and strive to better understand the world. I hold to structured and organized design pro- cesses and like to go within each project into depth while looking on requirements and plans holistically. As we live in an increasingly interconnected world, 

I strongly believe that it is important for a designer who has to deal with social, ecological and econo- mic problems to be exposed to as many different cultures as possible, in order to come up with ap- plicable solutions. To strengthen my expertise in a creative and global perspective and to deepen my understanding how to challenge complex problems in our society, I have chosen to pursue a Master's degree in System Design and Management at Keio University, Japan. The hands-on approach and fo- cus on today's complexity on a global stage are not only in continuation with my undergraduate academic achievements thus far, but also a mix of skillsets, that will help me reaching the professional future I'm passionate for. 

So, ...let's make something, and let's wow someone.

E-MOBILITY VEHICLE Within the scope of a semster pro- ject we developed in a team of two an alternative e-mobility vehicle, which aims a maximum in performance while being entirely compact.

RESEARCH 

In the foreseeable future urban mobility will be one of the biggest challenges of cities around the globe. Transport infrastructures will have to be steady im- proved. We are convinced that the importance of the automobile will decrease significantly. Instead new 

alternatives for personal mobility will characterise the appearance of town-scapes and impact peoples' every day life. What is the fastest way to get from point A to point B in a big city? In most cities it is the combined use of both public infrastructure and private vehicles.

consumer analysis We estimated a conceptual framework and model of commuters' travel choice behavior. This framework integrates models of consumer choices based on consumer behavior theory, 

marketing research, and transportation de- mand theory. The model is illustrated by a selection of preferential commuting ways and choice of travel mode for home-work travel.

We see the societal need of improved infrastruc- ture that combines economic necessity, ecological reason and social responsibility. A strongly growing urban population means an increase in mobility 

needs. An enhanced infrastructure in tomorrows mega cities can create efficient and effective reduce of energy consumption and high value for millions of commuters.

Branding Bendt AG A fictitious formation of a company which is shared and run by eight associate partners who are actively employed within the company Founder and partner: Markus Bendt Headquarter incl. design, research development: Frankfurt, Germany (Find the whole story on www.daniel-daum.com) 

As one of the first products in the young technology of personal e-mobility, Bendt AG presents Laax, an electric driven one-person vehicle. To time of progressive digitalization the company wants to be seen as the pioneer in shaping a new town scape. Within a five-year strategy Bendt AG opens 15 stores in Europe and USA and runs promotions on three channels.

CONCEPT 

make it compact The fastest commute is to make use of cities infrastructure. Within three steps users can foalt Laax into a compact size and pull it like a trolly into busses and trains. Finally Laax is just 90x45x26cm with just 15Kg. That's a suitcase!

omnidirectional! how it works With two thumb sticks - located at the holding grips - the user controls the movement. Using two fingers, all directions, the speed and even the braking is easily to navigate. Through every wheel has an own 

operating motor the speed of each wheel regulates the movement 

?

11 

Mecanum wheels have the main purpase to enable omni-directional movement. That means via electrical speed controling Laax transforms the movement of the thumbsticks into different rotations of the wheels. It is not just the speed but also the direction of the wheels which regulate the movement of the vehicle. For example, if the user aims to drive straight forward the wheels are spinning in the same speed into same direction. However, when the user makes a curve while driving, the speed of the single wheels becomes diffe- rent and when chnaging the direction into a parallel side- wards movement the wheels regulates their direction au- tomatically. The user just need to move the thumbsticks 

into the aimed direction. Four single 12-Volt AC-motors push the wheels into direction. A 2-stage gear regula- tes the rotation-speed of the motor into an appropriate velocity of the wheel with the result that both an carefully slow motion and maximum speed of 20km/h is easy to operate. Through the steering mechanism is completely automized the user can hold the grips to get a maximum of driving stability. No physical action or movement of the steering is needed to change the direction. The tech- nology of Laax consists out of just three crucial com- ponents: Speed-controler, motor and gear. The body of the gear is build in aluminium to reduce weight while the inner parts are made out of long lasting hardened steel.

RIPOL LOUDSPEAKER Within the scope of a semster pro- ject, I developed a loudspeaker for the deck of a sailing yacht. 

DESIGN BRIEF Create a loudspeaker-system following the ripol-principle for a freely selected clientele 

Single project Date: 2012 Duration: 8 weeks Cooperation: 

IN 2011 417 MOTOR- AND SAILING YACHTS WERE NEW TO THE MARKET 

ABOUT $2,000,000 IS THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE OF A TYPICAL 50' YACHT 

A PROBLEMS IS: 

WHILE PEOPLE ON DECK MAY LISTEN TO LOUD BEATS PEOPLE UNDER DECK COULD FEEL DISTURBED.

The water, salt, and sun that make boating so much fun can wreak havoc on boat's electrical components. If the gear isn't designed to withstand this environment, it won't last a season. 

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN MARINE AUDIO GEAR

CONCEPT 

The ripol-subwoofer system and speaker provide the sound from a central position on deck of the yacht 

POSITION 

Well, what is a ripole principle? Instead of the usual spherical shape of low sound waves the ripol radiates low frequency directed. As result, people on deck before and behind the system can enjoy deep beats while those under deck are not effected
