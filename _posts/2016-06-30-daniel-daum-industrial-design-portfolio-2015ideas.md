**SO... THAT'S ME!**

I am Daniel, a fresh industrial design graduate (BA) from Germany. From a very young age, I have had a passion for the arts and design with the result that now I am passionately curious about things.

It is very exciting to study and act in a field that is a hobby - or rather - have a passion that is a career.

Describing me in a couple of words I say positive, hard-working, happy and purposeful. I highly respect and appretiate all this beautiful and unique moments and things, which enriches our every day life. I have many interests and strive to better understand the world. I hold to structured and organized design pro- cesses and like to go within each project into depth while looking on requirements and plans holistically. As we live in an increasingly interconnected world,

I strongly believe that it is important for a designer who has to deal with social, ecological and econo- mic problems to be exposed to as many different cultures as possible, in order to come up with ap- plicable solutions. To strengthen my expertise in a creative and global perspective and to deepen my understanding how to challenge complex problems in our society, I have chosen to pursue a Master's degree in System Design and Management at Keio University, Japan. The hands-on approach and fo- cus on today's complexity on a global stage are not only in continuation with my undergraduate academic achievements thus far, but also a mix of skillsets, that will help me reaching the professional future I'm passionate for.

So, ...let's make something, and let's wow someone.
