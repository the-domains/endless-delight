**PROJECT "HARD HAT 2.0"**

> Construction projects have an ever increasing complex nature and rise up faster then ever before. The number of supertall buildings, that means 300m+, in the world has tripled in the last seven years and within the next three, buildings surpass the 1000m limit. The problem is, aquisition and use of modern information technology lags behind all other industries. Among other industries, construction projects have high pressure of costs and deadlines. Heightened price competition permits profits only if construction workflows run smooth.The error potential is hughe because sites are manned with a multitude of workman to the same time. With progressive technological development we witness increasingly large building structures and as a result more extensive projects will be realized on highest quality performance in shorter time. In future, therefore, the aquisition and use of information and communication techniólogy (ICT) could help to enhance both work efficiency and competitiveness of ventures and lead construction sites to safer and better secured workplaces.
